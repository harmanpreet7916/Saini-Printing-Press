## 📁 **Flexible Image System**

Your website now supports **both local images and online URLs**! This gives you maximum flexibility and reliability.

## 🔧 **How to Use Images**

### Option 1: Local Images (Recommended ✅)
Store your images in the `/images` folder and reference them in `designs.json`:

```json
{
    "name": "Your Design",
    "price": 999,
    "description": "Your description",
    "image": "images/your-design.jpg"
}
```

**Or just the filename (automatically goes to images folder):**
```json
{
    "image": "your-design.jpg"
}
```

### Option 2: Online URLs
Use direct image URLs from any website:

```json
{
    "name": "Your Design", 
    "price": 999,
    "description": "Your description",
    "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
}
```

## 📂 **Adding Your Own Images**

### Step 1: Save Your Image
1. Download your Independence Day image from Google Drive
2. Rename it to something like `independence-day.jpg`
3. Place it in the `/images` folder

### Step 2: Update designs.json
```json
{
    "name": "Independence Day Post",
    "price": 499,
    "description": "Independence Day Offer",
    "image": "images/independence-day.jpg"
}
```

## ✨ **Advanced Features**

### Automatic Error Handling
- If an image fails to load, it shows a "Image Not Found" placeholder
- System automatically detects URLs vs local files
- WhatsApp sharing includes full image URLs

### Both Systems Work Together
You can mix and match:
```json
[
    {
        "name": "Local Image",
        "image": "images/design1.jpg"
    },
    {
        "name": "Online Image", 
        "image": "https://example.com/design2.jpg"
    }
]
```

## 🚀 **Benefits**

### Local Images:
- ✅ **Faster loading** - No external dependencies
- ✅ **Always available** - Works even if internet is slow
- ✅ **Full control** - Your images, your server
- ✅ **Professional** - Consistent branding

### Online URLs:
- ✅ **Quick setup** - Just paste the URL
- ✅ **No storage needed** - Images hosted elsewhere
- ✅ **Dynamic** - Can change images without uploading

## 📱 **WhatsApp Integration**

Both local and online images work perfectly with WhatsApp:
- Local images get converted to full URLs automatically
- Customers can see the exact design they're ordering
- Share button works with both image types

## 🔄 **Current Examples**

Your website now shows:
1. **Independence Day Post** - Uses local SVG (images/independence-day.svg)
2. **Republic Day Special** - Uses online URL
3. **All other designs** - Use Unsplash URLs

Replace the Independence Day SVG with your actual image by:
1. Saving your image as `images/independence-day.jpg`
2. Updating the JSON to use `.jpg` instead of `.svg`

## 🎯 **Pro Tips**

1. **Use local images for your custom designs** - Better performance
2. **Use URLs for stock photos** - Saves storage space
3. **Optimize images** - Keep file sizes under 500KB for fast loading
4. **Use descriptive filenames** - `wedding-card-gold.jpg` not `img1.jpg`

Your image system is now future-proof and flexible! 🎉
